# Welcome!

This is a very simple app I created with NodeJS and TypeScript to manage argv arguments, and modify a multiplication method I had built in. I used the base approach of use cases from clean architecture to define the posibble functions, but I haven't yet implemented more indepth concepts like repositories and adapters on every thing.

Also, tests are being added with Jest so we can be sure our code is working properly.

Thansk!
